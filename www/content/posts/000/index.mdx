I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.

# Heading 1

We have a _fantastic little sky_! :+1: We must be quiet, **soft and gentle**. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. It all happens automatically.

## Heading 2

Let your <kbd>heart</kbd> be <sub>your</sub> guide. <sup>You're</sup> meant `to` have `fun` in life. There we are. There are no limits in [this world](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Strangereal). Those great big fluffy [clouds caption or-alt-text](https://area.autodesk.com/blogs/game-dev-blog/volumetric-clouds/).

### Heading 3

A little happy sunlight shining through there. There we go. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.

#### Heading 4

See there, told you that would be easy. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Just let these leaves jump off the brush

##### Heading 5

And right there you got an almighty cloud. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Just a little indication. Let's have a nice tree right here. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.

###### Heading 6

> Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.
>
> We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. And maybe a little bush lives there. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun We don't want to set these clouds on fire.
